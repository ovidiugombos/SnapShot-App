Hello :)  üòè 

Snapshot is a React application that allows users to search and display images from Flickr API. 
Users can search for any image by typing in one or more keywords, 
and also filter images by category using button selection.

The primary goal of this project was to learn how to use Context API, pagination, fetching, controlling state management in React, and other functionalities. 
Additionally, the project showcases how to integrate Flickr API to display images and how to implement filter functionality.
